Hi, I’m Paul

In 2025, I earned my Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science from RWTH Aachen University, where I will also begin my Master’s studies.

In 2024, I was fortunate to gain two wonderful international experiences: a research internship at the Robotics Institute at Carnegie Mellon University and an exchange semester at Aalto University.

I am still exploring which research directions excite me most, but I am particularly interested in graph theory and its applications in optimization and machine learning.
